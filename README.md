Drawing from the "Data on Energy" dataset by Our World in Data (1900-2020), this project delves into analyzing the convergence of energy consumption trends among nations adhering to socialist and capitalist ideologies. Our investigation concentrates on renewable energy consumption, specifically focusing on biofuels, hydro energy, other renewables, solar energy, and wind energy. These selections not only represent pivotal renewable energy sources but also enjoy familiarity among audiences, given their prominence in our dataset. Spanning from 2002 to 2022, our analysis aims to shed light on the trajectory of energy consumption within these distinct ideological frameworks.

The selected energy types represent significant components of renewable energy consumption per capita. We observed a widespread adoption of these energies post-2002 across most countries, prompting our focus on this period. To mitigate data inconsistencies, one representative country from each ideology—USA for capitalism and China for socialism—was chosen.

To effectively communicate our findings, we opted for bar charts over pie charts due to their clarity in comparing energy consumption across types. The choice of colors—red for China and blue for the USA—mirrors their respective national flags, aiding in audience recognition. Converting raw data to percentages on the y-axis ensures equitable comparison, especially for smaller values, enhancing visualization accuracy. 

Incorporating interactive features not only enhances audience engagement but also aids comprehension. Subtitles dynamically display the year depicted in the graph, facilitating temporal tracking, while a slider empowers users to navigate seamlessly between different years, fostering a nuanced understanding of evolving consumption patterns. Additionally, the inclusion of tooltips within the graph further enriches the viewer's experience by providing specific information such as the country, year, type of renewable energy consumption, and its corresponding percentage in each bar. As the slider moves, the height of bars adjusts dynamically, offering a visual representation of changes over time and enabling users to grasp the intricacies of renewable energy consumption trends with clarity and precision. To enhance user interaction with the graph, we've implemented specific design features in the tooltip. We've adjusted the tooltip's opacity to 0.9 upon activation to ensure viewers can easily discern the numbers and information it presents, without interference from the axis labels. Furthermore, recognizing challenges in selecting and viewing tooltips for smaller data points in the bar chart, we've expanded the hit area. It now encompasses not just the physical area of the bar but also extends a few pixels above, making the experience more accessible and user-friendly.

We considered an alternative chart which is pie chart. The reason that we eventually settled with bar chart is that we prioritized its inherent advantages in effectively conveying complex data on energy consumption. Unlike pie charts, which can sometimes obscure the relative sizes of different segments and make comparisons challenging, bar charts offer a clear and concise means of representing consumption levels across various energy types. By aligning each energy source with a distinct bar, viewers can easily discern differences in consumption magnitudes, enabling a more nuanced understanding of consumption trends. This clarity is crucial when analyzing multiple energy sources simultaneously, as it allows for precise comparisons and facilitates the identification of key patterns and outliers. Furthermore, bar charts excel in accommodating numerical data, providing a platform for accurate and detailed representations of consumption levels. This precision is particularly valuable when examining large datasets or subtle variations in consumption patterns over time. Additionally, the flexibility of bar charts allows for diverse representations, such as grouping or stacking bars to visualize different aspects of consumption. Overall, the clarity, ease of interpretation, accuracy, and flexibility offered by bar charts make them an ideal choice for effectively communicating our findings on energy consumption trends.

A notable trend observed through the interactive analysis is the diversification of renewable energy consumption patterns in both countries. This trend signifies a convergence between socialist and capitalist nations in embracing renewable energy sources.

Through meticulous data analysis and visualization techniques, this project sheds light on the evolving landscape of renewable energy consumption in the USA and China. By highlighting convergence in consumption trends, we underscore the global shift towards energy diversity and sustainability.

In developing our interactive visualization, our journey began with a collaborative discussion on the dataset and visualization theme. We settled on exploring the dynamics of energy consumption patterns across different countries, initially envisioning a geospatial visualization featuring a world map where users could interact with any country to observe changes in energy consumption patterns. However, the challenge of extensive missing data prompted us to pivot towards a more focused comparison between China and the US from 2002 to 2022, opting for clarity and directness in our visualization approach.

We embarked on our project by constructing a single visualization for the US, incorporating a slider for temporal navigation, before integrating a parallel visualization for China. Concurrently, we dedicated efforts to developing tooltips that offered detailed insights, enhancing the informational depth for viewers. Following the assembly of our main components, our focus shifted towards refining the visualization's aesthetic and interactive qualities. This refinement process included adjusting tooltip formatting, optimizing the visualization's title, and fine-tuning the slider's position and background color to enrich the user experience.
